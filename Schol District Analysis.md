# School District Analysis
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The school board has requested a revision of the previous analysis due to suspected academic dishonesty. The school board believes that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School (THS) ninth graders were altered. Due to the evidence found and wanting to uphold state-testing standards, they have requested this analysis. The analysis includes replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?
By running the analysis without the THS ninth graders, the modified results are not significant as the overall passing percentage only went down .27% with the reduction of the THS ninth graders.
